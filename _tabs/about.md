ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm **Luiz Paese** â€” a DevOps and infrastructure professional, currently working at **Thomson Reuters**. I have about **3 and a half years of experience** in the field, and I've faced different challenges in the tech world, from infrastructure support to cloud automation.

Nowadays, I work a lot with **AWS**, **CloudFormation**, and **Python**, but I also have a great interest in **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Terraform** â€” tools that make our work more scalable, versioned, and reliable.

I created this blog with the idea of **sharing experiences**, learnings, and maybe even some struggles that are part of the DevOps life. Here you will find **technical posts**, **code examples**, and practical content about infrastructure, automation, CI/CD, and other daily geek stuff.

I have a **bachelor's degree in Information Systems** and a **postgraduate degree in DevOps & Continuous Software Engineering**. I like to learn, try out new technologies, and look for better ways to deliver software.

Away from the terminal, I enjoy playing **table tennis** and have started to venture into the world of **running**.
